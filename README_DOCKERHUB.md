## üß∞ Maintenance

### Software Update

```bash
cd /YOUR_PATH/aignition
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

### Backup Data

- `runtime` is the data that AIgnition stores. DO NOT lose it.
- Use `Export data > Save archive` and `Import data > From archive` to backup and restore data in the `Data` panel.

### Log File

You can check the log file(useful for troubleshooting and password recovery) in the `runtime/logs`.

## ‚ùì FAQ

### What if I deleted some important notes without backups?

Your data is automatically backed up every 30 minutes. You can find these backups in the `runtime/data/db/main_backup` directory. To restore your data, simply replace the contents of the `main.db` file with the contents of the desired backup file, then restart the app manually.

> Uploads are NOT backup automatically.

### Is AIgnition open source?
