## Dev Mode

In development mode, you can run the project directly, and the code will automatically hot update after modification. At the same time, the project will start a `web server`, making it easier for you to access the project in your browser and test its functionality.

You can access the project by visiting [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.
