# ðŸ“¦ Packaging

## Docker Image

```bash
npm run package:docker
```

You may need to modify the packaging script file `package\docker\package.ts` based on your actual needs (e.g., custom image name).

## Node.JS APP

Quickly generate a NodeJS-based app that can run directly on a system with pre-installed Node.JS, or can be further packaged as a Docker image or Electron app.

```bash
npm run package:regular
```
